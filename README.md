# C++ 3D graphics manipulator
ðŸ§Š Rendering a 3D cube using C++ enhanced with the Qt libraries. This project was created for practice with 3D transformation topics such as translation and rotation, and to gain a deeper understanding of how 3D graphics engines work.
## Project overview
This project was developed to improve understanding of 3D graphics engines by using only C++ and the Qt Creator to build the user interface.
### Functionalities
The application allows several manipulations of the 3D cube, including:
  * #### Object Transformations
    Translations along the x, y, and z axes:<br>
